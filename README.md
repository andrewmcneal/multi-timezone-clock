# multi-timezone-clock

This is a clock that shows multiple time-zones. In particular it shows GMT/UTC, Eastern, Central, Mountain, and Pacific. It requires Tkinter, pytz, time, and datetime.

This application was created when I worked third shift at a middle mile carrier. We had customers in multiple time zones and this clock allowed for the easy cross referencing of times during maintenance windows. It was originally written as a command line clock and then migrated to a GUI platform as I was broadening my skills to include basic desktop style applications.
