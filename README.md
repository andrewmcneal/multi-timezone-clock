# multi-timezone-clock

This is a clock that shows multiple time-zones. In particular it shows GMT/UTC, Eastern, Central, Mountain, and Pacific. It requires Tkinter, pytz, time, and datetime. You will need these installed the environment you are using.

This application was created when I worked third shift at a middle mile carrier. We had customers in multiple time zones and this clock allowed for the easy cross referencing of times during maintenance windows. It was originally written as a command line clock and then migrated to a GUI platform as I was broadening my skills to include basic desktop style applications. 

The clock does not automatically start. There is a button at the bottom that is titled Start. once the application loads click that button and it will auto update the time. I currently have this only showing hours and minutes as seconds are not of importance for the intended purpose of this clock. Additional upgrades will be released in this repository.
